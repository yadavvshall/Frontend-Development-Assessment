		<Option><![CDATA[Enteral feedings should also be withheld if you suspect the infant has a bowel obstruction or if there is an obvious abdominal wall defect such as <span style="color:#e4bb4d;" href="javascript:void(0)" class="glossarytag" textDesc="An abdominal wall defect that allows herniation of intestine and in more complex cases, other organs, outside of the abdominal cavity. There is no covering membrane, which allows the intestine to be exposed to the amniotic fluid. Gastroschisis occurs just to the right of the umbilical cord, although in rare cases, the defect may originate from the left side of the umbilicus. There is no known genetic association at this time. Other anomalies are not common; however, in a small percentage of patients, there may be central nervous system, cardiovascular, limb, or kidney anomalies. The incidence of gastroschisis is 1 in 2000 births.">gastroschisis</span> or <span  style="color:#e4bb4d;" href="javascript:void(0)" class="glossarytag" textDesc="A midline abdominal wall defect that allows herniation of intestine and possibly the liver and other organs outside of the abdominal cavity. There is a covering membrane consisting of peritoneum (inside layer), amnion (outside layer), and Wharton jelly between the two layers. At times, the membrane is ruptured, which may cause confusion with a gastroschisis defect. The umbilical cord is inserted into the membrane rather than the abdominal wall. In approximately 70% of cases, associated anomalies are common and include congenital heart disease. Infants with trisomy 13, 18, and other syndromes, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, may have an omphalocele. The incidence of omphalocele is between 1.5 and 3 per 10,000 births. Omphalocele is known as exomphalos in the United Kingdom.">omphalocele</span>.]]></Option>

The umbilical cord connects to the central portion of the membrane. A smaller omphalocele may be subtle, so carefully assess the umbilical cord before clamping.]]></Option>

		<Option><![CDATA[The images here show bilious or green-colored emesis, which is one important sign that might alert you to the presence of a bowel obstruction. Never assume bilious emesis to be normal. It should be reported immediately to the medical staff so that the infant can receive a thorough exam to evaluate for potential bowel obstruction. Bilious emesis is a classic presenting sign of a life-threatening surgical problem called malrotation, which is shown in the image on the left.]]></Option>
